## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. Arithmetic Operators - Considering the operations are similar to (or even the same as) C++ operators, it felt easy to transition into Java arithmetic operators. There were only a few alterations, such as strict equality (===).
2. Conditional Control Structures (if, else if, else) - The conditional statements in Java are similar to those in Python and C++. It was easy to transition.
3. Loops (while, do-while, for) - The loops in Java are similar to those in Python and C++. It was easy to transition.
4. Function Declaration - The functions in Java have a relatively simple syntax. They also share similarities with C++, so it feels easy to transition.
5. Variables - Most of the variable types in Java are similar to those in Python and C++, so for the most part, it was easy to transition. Declaring them (let, var, const) was also easy to learn.

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.
1. How to return outputs (document.write, return) - I encountered more ways on how to print outputs of programs. While I can use them relatively well, I would like more clarification on when to use the different functions to print.
2. parse and math functions - This was a new topic for me. Normally, if I wanted to round or floor a number, I would've just made a function to do that. I had a hard time remembering what exactly each function did, though I managed to persevere.
3. Switch - I have a hard time remembering the syntax of the switch case. I do understand how it works though and its basic essence. I simply prefer using the if statements.
4. The concept of Java being dynamic - For example, how it can still "perform" normal arithmetic operations, even though a value is in quotation marks (i.e., 5 + '3' = 53). Considering the value in quotations isn't really considered a integer, I expected there to be an error, though in Java, it simply puts the numbers side by side.
5. ++x and x++ - In C++ and Python, there was only method of increasing a value: x++ (pre-increment). In Java, however, we have ++x (post-increment). I normally get confused on which is which and how to use each.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
I would experiment in compilers to try and see how certain functions work, both on display and in the console. I'd also try to simplify concepts. For example, I can remind myself that adding values in quotation marks means that you're adding the string, not the actual value. The x in ++x and x++ indicates whether it's a pre-increment (before the ++) or a post-increment (after the ++). I'd also learn the switch case, even though I still prefer if statements.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

### Effective
1. Speed tests - The speed tests were able to test just how quickly we can utilize what we learned in class to make a functioning program. Plus, bonus points are always nice.
2. Kahoot - Kahoot is a fun way to see how well you know the lesson. It's also able to help me memorize certain concepts better, since it's better engrained in your mind if you managed to rank up after answering a question right, or fall if you answer a question wrong.

### Not effective
I believe there are no activities that we did this quarter in CS that aren't effective. Each of them helped me to understand the concepts better, even though I may not always get it.
